# MNISTClassification

Handwritten digit classifier

- Built and trained a simple perceptron, a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a simple convolutional neural network (CNN), and a CNN with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions using Tensorflow.
- Used feature analysis to compare the strengths and weaknesses of adding convolutional layers and/or ReLU layers.
